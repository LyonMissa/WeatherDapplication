# WeatherDapplication-Aedev-101

Hi i developed a Weather application implementing the AccuWeather Api to get real time weather information globally, and then implemented the app on the aeternity blockchain. Users can get access to real time Weather updates on the aeternity blockchain by simply going on the base app, input the site Url, after displaying type any location they would love to know the weather condition, pay a minimum ae fee for access then get real time weather information on the aeternity blockchain. Very optimized, efficient and straight forward to ensure user responsiveness. i got this idea from the weather aepp example given on the course on oracles and accessing real world data on the blockchain. Thanks, happy weather updates and feedbacks are welcome.

#UPDATE

updated the contract and added a function to keep record of all users who utilized the aepp to get weather updates to give it tranparency and interactivity.
